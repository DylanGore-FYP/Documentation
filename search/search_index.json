Requirements Raspberry Pi Micro SD Card OBD-II Adapter LCD Display (Optional) GPS Adapter/HAT Preparing the Raspberry Pi Install the Operating System Flash an SD Card with the latest version of Raspberry Pi OS. The recommended way to do this is to use the Raspberry Pi Imager but something like balenaEtcher can be used if preferrrd. This guide assums that that standard version of Raspberry Pi OS is being used (the one with the desktop environment) but feel free to use Raspberry Pi OS Lite if no display is needed. Configure Headless Operation This step is optional if using a display but makes things a bit easier to configure later. Plug the SD card into the computer and open the boot partition. Add a file called ssh (with no file extension) to enable the SSH server. Add a file called wpa_supplicant.conf to pre-configure your Wi-Fi network(s). Below is a sample file that has two networks with a different priority, if only one network is needed, remove the second network block. Dopne forget to update the country with the ISO 3166-1 two letter country code for your location. c trl _i nterfa ce=DIR=/var/ru n /wpa_supplica nt GROUP= net dev upda te _co nf ig= 1 cou ntr y=IE net work= { ssid= \"Network 1\" psk= \"PASSWORD\" priori t y= 1 } net work= { ssid= \"Network 2\" psk= \"PASSWORD\" priori t y= 2 } See this guide on headless setup from the Raspberry Pi website for more information. Ansible Setup Coming soon! Manual Setup Basic Raspberry Pi Setup Update the default password: passwd pi Update the software on the Raspberry Pi to the latest version. sudo apt update sudo apt upgrade If you need to change any basic settings (hostname, Wi-Fi, language, etc.), this can be done using raspi-config : sudo raspi-config You may need to reboot at this point. sudo reboot now Download the Code Info This is a temporary solution, the final insturctions will have an easier installation method. Clone the code from GitHub using git: git clone https://github.com/DylanGore-FYP/Car.git Or, download and extract this zip file. Install pipenv This project uses pipenv to manage dependencies. To install it, run: pip3 install pipenv On Debian-based systems, pipenv can also be installed using apt : apt install pipenv Once pipenv is installed, cd into the downloaded code and run: pipenv install This will install all of the required dependencies in a virtual environment. To access the virtual environment, run: pipenv shell Note: All instructions after this point assume you are runing within the virtual environment unless stated otherwise Configuration All configuration is done within a config.toml file. A sample file comes with the repo. Copy it and rename it to use it as a starting point. cp config.sample.toml config.toml","title":"Vehicle"},{"location":"setup/vehicle/#vehicle","text":"Warning This section of the documentation is incomplete!
